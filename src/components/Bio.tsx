          Hi, I'm Regis Pak. I'm a senior at UCSC studying Computer Science Game Design, 
          I've been playing games my entire life, but really took my first steps into 
          game design with a course during my senior year of high school. It taught some 
          basics, and I felt new aspirations into this field and started continuing it 
          in college. I mainly make games within Unity 3d, but I've started learning Unreal. 
          Here are some of the projects I've made throughout University. This Itch is just to hold 
          me over until I can finish learning HTML / CSS to make a website I like. 
          Thanks for stopping by.
